# Introduction
This [**demo-TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA**](demo-TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA) contains a simple TLS verification.
It contains a full https wireshark captured data,and a script record named 'inst.txt' that gives instructions how to verify and decrypt fields of the TLS.

Good luck!
